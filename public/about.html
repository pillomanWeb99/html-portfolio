<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a Software developer specialized in Business Line Applications for desktop on the Windows Operating System. For my developments, I have been using the Clarion tool from Softvelocity for 20 years. My developments have been mainly focused on creating applications for the Government sector: Accounting, Budgeting, Collection of Property Taxes, Water Supply, Various Revenues, etc.</p>

<p>Currently, I am in the process of learning web application development, so I am taking courses on Web Development and its associated technologies: HTML, CSS. I intend to focus my efforts on a JavaScript stack and another using Python, as well as exploring lesser-known technologies like Haskell and Elixir, along with their respective web development frameworks (Yesod, IHP, Phoenix).</p>
